### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior looking for a full-time internship in software development. I have experience in JAVA, PYTHON, SQL, HTML/CSS, and other developing programs. In the future, I want to aid companies in building more creative and efficient programs for their clients or products. I have great experience in database related work with problem-solving skills. In my spare time, I enjoy running, traveling, and most of the time sleeping :)
